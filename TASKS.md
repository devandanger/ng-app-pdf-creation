## Development Order Recommendation

1. Start with Phase 1-2 (Infrastructure and Grid)
2. Implement Phase 3-4 (Basic Drag/Drop)
3. Add Phase 5 (Properties) for immediate feedback
4. Implement Phase 7 (PDF Export) to validate core functionality
5. Add Phase 6 (Images) to complete main features
6. Enhance with Phase 8-10 based on priorities
